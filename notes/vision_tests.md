## Models

Tests that passed are not mentioned below.

gpt-3.5-turbo: Fails 3
deepseek/deepseek-chat: Passes all 3!
meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct: Passes all 3 but sorta weirdly for tests 1 and 2
microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b: Fails 3 (likely censored)
microsoft/wizardlm-2-7b: Pretty much fails 2 (but uncensored???)
anthropic/claude-3-haiku:beta: Fails 3 (likely censored)
mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct: Passes all 3!
gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b: Pretty much fails 2

Multi-modal (text and vision):
google/gemini-pro-vision: Fails text 3 (likely censored), half on vision 3, almost nothing on vision 4
anthropic/claude-3-haiku:beta Fails text 3 (likely censored), half on vision 3, almost nothing on vision 4
fireworks/firellava-13b: Passes but a bit weird for text 2, vision doesn't work for some reason. :/
google/gemini-flash-1.5: Fails text 3 (likely censored), gets vision 3!, i'd say 30% on vision 4, but keeps cutting off early, not very useful...
openai/gpt-4o-mini: Fails text 3 (strictly censored), half on vision 3, ~30% on vision 4
openai/gpt-4o: Fails text 3 (strictly censored), probably gets all vision
anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:beta: Fails text 3 (censored), gets vision 3!, GETS VISION 4 (after a manual followup question)!!! Does hallucinate a bit though.
anthropic/claude-3-haiku:beta: Fails text 3 (censored), half on vision 3, almost nothing on vision 4

I replicated this on Playground. Surprisingly, GPT-4o doesn't seem as good at this kinda thing.
